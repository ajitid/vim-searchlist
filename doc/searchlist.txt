INTRODUCTION                                    *searchlist*

This plugin adds a searchlist to Neovim. The searchlist is similar to the
jumplist, but instead of storing jumps, it stores the locations where you last
initiated a search.


TODO                                            *searchlist-todo*

In no particular order:

[ ] Complete docs
[ ] Do not add duplicate entries to the searchlist
[ ] Find an alternative to `cursor()` that modifies the jumplist
[ ] Squah bugs
