INTRODUCTION                                    *searchlist*

This plugin adds a searchlist to Neovim. The searchlist is similar to the
jumplist, but instead of storing jumps, it stores the locations where you last
initiated a search.


MAPS                                            *searchlist-maps*

The plugin introduces two normal mode maps:

                                                *g\*
`g\`                    Jump backwards [count] positions in the searchlist
                      ([count] defaults to one).

                                                *g/*
`g/`                    Jump forwards [count] positions in the searchlist
                      ([count] defaults to one).

                                                *searchlist-shadows*
In order to save positions to the searchlist, the plugin also shadows the
following built-in maps:

    `/`, `?`, `*`, `#`, `g*`, `g#`, `gd`, `gD`


CUSTOMISATION                                   *searchlist-customisation*

                                                *g:searchlist_maps*
If you would prefer to disable some or all of the default maps, the
`g:searchlist_maps` variable can be used.

`let g:searchlist_maps = "none"`
Do not remap any keys.

`let g:searchlist_maps = "all"`
Default, use the default set of maps.

`let g:searchlist_maps = "search_only"`
Only set search maps.

`let g:searchlist_maps = "jump_only"`
Only set jump maps (|g\|, |g/|).

                                                *searchlist-custom-jump-maps*
                                                *searchlist#JumpBackwards*
                                                *searchlist#JumpForwards*
If you want to create custom maps for jumping backwards/forwards in the
searchlist, you can use the `searchlist#JumpBackwards` and
`searchlist#JumpForwards` functions. For example:
>
    nnoremap <silent> <leader>sf :call searchlist#JumpForwards()<cr>
    nnoremap <silent> <leader>sb :call searchlist#JumpBackwards()<cr>
<

                                                *searchlist-custom-search-maps*
                                                *searchlist#AddEntry*

If you already have maps inside your Neovim configuration that shadow the
built-in Neovim search maps (see |searchlist-shadows|), you will probably
require some extra configuration to get them to play nicely with this plugin.

As an example, suppose that you have the following popular map in your Neovim
configuration:
>
    nnoremap / /\v
<
To preserve this behaviour, but also have this plugin record your position in
the searchlist, you would want something like this:
>
    function! CustomSearchBinding() abort
        call searchlist#AddEntry()
        return "/\\v"
    endfunction

    nnoremap <expr> / CustomSearchBinding()
<
